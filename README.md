`libMenu` is a customizable library for creating interactive menu screens.  
`libGui` is a customizable (but small) library for creating labels and buttons (with callbacks) declaratively.  
`libTimer` is a library that allows setting timers with callbacks, similarly to setInterval in JavaScript.  
`libBindKey` is a small framework that allows binding callbacks to specific keys or buttons.  
`libNameEntry` is a library that allows you to read a (short) name from the user, and is compatible with all platforms that run TIC-80 and support the `btnp()` function
